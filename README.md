Powerbi-dashboard
This Power BI sales dashboard presents an interactive and dynamic analysis of 
sales data sourced from Kaggle. The dashboard features a variety of visual components,
including summary cards (KPIs), bar and line graphs, pie charts, and an interactive
map for regional insights. It displays key metrics such as total sales, profit, 
quantity sold, and order volume across different time frames, product categories, and customer segments.

Users can filter data through slicers and dropdowns, making the dashboard fully 
dynamic and responsive to user input. Visualizations update in real-time based on 
selected criteria, allowing for detailed comparisons and trend analysis. The geographical 
map highlights sales distribution across countries or regions, while category-wise
breakdowns identify top-performing products and segments.
